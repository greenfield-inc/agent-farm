# Cross-OS QA through Pane Workspaces

For OS-sensitive changes or cross-platform claims, discover reachable machines,
run isolated checks, and collect proof per OS. OS-sensitive work includes paths,
shells, native modules, installers, desktop UI, terminals, file watching, line
endings, WSL interop, and simulators. Keep the caller's authorization, delegation,
time, and publication limits; preserve the PR's current draft/ready state.

## Detect and plan

In a Pane Session, find and read its original `runtime-context.md` through the supplied
brief or Session AGENTS instructions. Use its bundled bridge (`PANE_RUNPANE_BIN`
or the named path), with the required `--pane-dir` on every call. WSL needs that
Windows bridge to reach Pane's named pipe; global Linux runpane targets Linux
sockets. The bridge handles Windows TEMP, PowerShell, and path translation.

Run `runpane doctor --json`. For a Windows-host bridge, confirm `wrapper.paneDir`
matches the Session, `platform.os` is `win32`, and `daemon.reachable` is true.
Missing context, bridge, or matching daemon is BLOCKED; continue independent
local checks. All local `runpane` examples below mean this verified invocation,
including its required flags. Remote commands use the remote machine's own
runpane and data directory.

Run `runpane workspace list --json` and `runpane agent-context --json`. When
`workspaces.state` is `on`, match online `otherMachines` with the list's OS and
`info.wslDistros`, `info.isWsl` / `isWsl` details. Confirm shell/app readiness;
online status and listed distros identify candidates, not completed checks.

Plan the relevant checks once per reachable OS, including the local OS. Use
one machine per OS unless architecture/runtime differences matter. Include all
claimed platforms: offline machines, disabled Workspaces, or unavailable tools
get BLOCKED rows with reasons. Leave infrastructure changes to their owner.
Name WSL distros separately from native Windows. For OS-neutral work, state why
local checks suffice. Continue independent platforms when another is blocked.

## Run and observe

Read installed syntax with `runpane agent-context --command "<command>" --json`
and discover each machine's saved repo with `runpane repos list --json`. Use
its paths and shell quoting. On this machine, QA runs as a new agent tab in the
feature's existing Pane (`runpane panels create --pane <id>`), never a new Pane.
Another machine has no worktree for the feature, so it gets one QA Pane per
feature: create it once and reuse it for every later QA run there. Prefer that
visible QA Pane when delegation is allowed;
leaf helpers use direct exec and return agent requests (OS, SHA, check plan) to
the parent. The parent owns authorized launches and evidence collection, or
reports the platform BLOCKED. This applies to both Pane creation and handoff.

`panes create` owns the new worktree, so use it only when that machine has no Pane
for this feature yet; pass a saved base repo as `--repo`. Require
the QA agent to fetch/check out the target SHA there and isolate the app before
testing. Replace all placeholders in these templates:

```sh
# This machine: a tab in the feature's Pane.
runpane panels create --pane <feature-pane-id> --agent <agent> --initial-input "<SHA, checks, evidence, isolation>" --source agent --no-focus --wait-ready --yes --json
# Another machine, first QA run for this feature only:
runpane workspace <machine> exec -- 'runpane panes create --repo <remote-repo> --name <qa-name> --agent <agent> --prompt "<SHA, checks, evidence, isolation>" --source agent --no-focus --wait-ready --yes --json'
# Later QA runs on that machine: a tab in its existing QA Pane.
runpane workspace <machine> exec -- 'runpane panels create --pane <remote-qa-pane-id> --agent <agent> --initial-input "<SHA, checks, evidence, isolation>" --source agent --no-focus --wait-ready --yes --json'
# Direct checks also suit helpers that cannot delegate.
runpane workspace <machine> exec -- '<command>'
```

Alternatively, inspect `runpane handoff "<agent> on <machine>" --note-file <note>
--dry-run`; run without `--dry-run` when the target/actions fit authorized QA.
Carry the same SHA, checks, isolation, and evidence requirements in the note.

Read Pane/panel IDs from the result or `panels list --pane <id>`. Route remote
`panels screen`, `input`, `submit`, and `last-message` through that machine's
workspace exec. Inspect after launch/submission, wait for completion, read the
final message, and retrieve logs/media. Discover command schemas as needed.

For WSL, select a distro from `wsl.exe --list --quiet`, then execute explicitly:
`wsl.exe -d <distro> -- bash -lc '<check>'`, quoted for the outer shell too.
Inside the distro, establish the Linux repo path and capture `uname -s`, distro
identity, and `git rev-parse HEAD` with the output. A failed start is BLOCKED.

Fetch/check out the requested SHA in each machine’s isolated checkout,
including direct-exec checks; verify `git rev-parse HEAD` before tests. For a
composite merge commit, record its SHA and prove the requested head is included
with `git merge-base --is-ancestor <requested-head> HEAD`. Retain `git status
--short` and the patch for dirty trees; label that evidence as dirty-state proof.
Preserve the person's checkout and running Pane instance. Use separate
dependencies/build output, ports, app user-data, and Pane app-build `PANE_DIR`.
Scope `PANE_DIR` to the test app while the orchestration CLI stays connected
to its existing daemon. Clean up only resources this run created.

## Collect per-OS proof

Repeat the same planned check rows per OS/runtime. Mark OS-specific rows
Skipped (not applicable) elsewhere. For executed checks, capture actual
commands, stdout/stderr, exit codes, machine/runtime, exact SHAs, and evidence
paths. Pair baseline failing/old behavior with candidate behavior under the
same check: screenshots/recordings for UI, command output for CLI. If the
baseline cannot run, mark before/after proof BLOCKED with the reason; report
any candidate-only pass separately.

Keep evidence in the caller's temporary folder, separated by OS. Name the
machine for remote paths and retrieve artifacts for review when possible.

| OS / runtime | Baseline → tested SHA | Check / command | Result | Before → after evidence; exit codes / reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <OS, WSL distro> | <base> → <head> | <check; actual command> | PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED | <paired proof or blocker> |

Give every planned platform a verdict for its applicable checks:

- `✓ PASS on <OS>`: all planned checks passed with evidence.
- `✗ FAIL on <OS>: <failure>`: an exercised check failed.
- `BLOCKED on <OS>: <reason>; unverified`: proof is missing or incomplete;
  list any completed checks separately.

A native OS pass requires the relevant real path executing on that OS with
command/output and tested SHA. Label mocks, fake transports, OS overrides,
portable unit tests, connectivity, and agent launches by what they prove.
WSL evidence proves its named Linux runtime; Windows requires native execution.

## Practical lessons

- **Bridge flags:** some WSL→Windows bridges append `--pane-dir` after the
  remote command. In shells supporting `#` comments, end that command with
  ` #` to absorb the flag. ` ; echo #` can mask the check's status; preserve
  its original exit code. Check the returned shell/status; cmd.exe lacks
  `#` comments. Outside a configured Session, discover Windows runpane and
  invoke it via PowerShell from a Windows directory.
- **Borrow tools:** use a machine's existing `gh` authentication with
  `runpane workspace <mac> exec -- 'cd <repo> && gh …'`. Set GitHub targets
  explicitly and keep credentials on their host; caller publication rules apply.
- **Delivery:** Codex queues `panels submit` until its turn ends; `delivery.state:
  queued` confirms queued input, not that it was read. For urgent corrections
  to your QA agent, send `panels input --panel <id> --keys escape`, submit the
  correction, and inspect `panels screen`. Leave unrelated agents running.
- **First run:** inspect `panels screen` for Claude/Codex folder-trust dialogs
  or Codex's “Cannot use the background server → Run without daemon this time”.
  Answer for the intended checkout with `panels input --keys …` under the
  caller's authorization. Treat `verifiedSubmitted:false` or
  `composer.hasUndeliveredText:true` as unconfirmed delivery; inspect and submit
  as needed before counting the task running.
- **Electron capture:** macOS background capture needs Screen Recording
  permission; Windows gdigrab can give black frames. CDP capture of the isolated
  app (`--remote-debugging-port`, `Page.startScreencast`) works without OS capture
  permission on macOS, Windows, and WSL. Bind debugging locally, collect and
  acknowledge frames, and inspect media. CDP covers web contents; verify native
  dialogs/OS chrome separately when relevant.
- **Windows fixtures:** use hermetic fake daemons/transports for portable tests;
  extensionless shebang fake CLIs fail natively. Test real native execution when
  that boundary matters, and label fixture results separately.
- **Disk pressure:** pnpm node_modules may share hard links with its store, so
  deleting them reclaims little. `pnpm store prune` frees unused store content;
  treat it as shared-machine maintenance requiring coordination with its owner.
- **WSL→Windows handoff:** affected versions look for a Linux daemon socket.
  Check dry-run and execution results; use Mac↔Windows routes or Windows-bridge
  direct checks while affected. Report remaining route gaps as BLOCKED.
