# Babysit PR

Most repositories run AI review bots and CI on every pull request. They are helpful, even when they are not right.

## Watch

Watch the PR instead of checking once. In Claude Code, run `gh pr checks <pr> --watch` in the background or use a monitor, so you respond when checks or comments arrive. In Codex, or wherever nothing can wake you, poll `gh pr checks <pr>` and the review threads every few minutes.

Only act on checks and comments newer than the latest push. Compare their timestamps with the head commit:

```bash
gh pr view <pr> --json headRefOid,commits,statusCheckRollup,reviews,comments
```

Review threads, and whether they are resolved, come from GraphQL:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='query($o:String!,$r:String!,$n:Int!){repository(owner:$o,name:$r){pullRequest(number:$n){reviewThreads(first:100){nodes{id isResolved comments(last:1){nodes{author{login} body createdAt path line}}}}}}}' -f o=<owner> -f r=<repo> -F n=<pr>
```

## Act

Verify every bot finding against the source before changing code. Fix real findings and CI failures. Tell repository failures apart from infrastructure flakes; rerun a flake once with `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed` before treating it as real.

If a review bot leaves feedback that is not worth addressing, reply with a written reason and resolve the thread:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){thread{isResolved}}}' -f id=<thread-id>
```

Every reply is posted under the person's account. Write it the way they would: short, specific, and without filler.

Screenshots and videos help reviewers. Host them where the repository's workflow says (the document destination your workspace instructions name, or a release asset, for example) and link them. Never commit evidence files.

Keep an eye on the base branch and rebase when needed. If an overlapping PR makes this one obsolete, stop monitoring, tell the person, and ask before closing it unless closing was explicitly authorized.

Keep the PR to the person's original goal: address real shortcomings, and leave broader suggestions for later.

## Stop

If nothing has changed, stay quiet rather than posting filler comments. Stop when the review bots and required checks are green on the latest commit. Merge only when the person explicitly asked for it; otherwise report that the PR is ready.
