name: codex
description: Dispatches one Codex (GPT-6.1 Sol) sub-agent via `codex exec` - implementer, backend-verifier, plan-reviewer, code-reviewer, code-researcher, or investigator - and returns its report. Used by /do, /discussion, and /create-brief whenever one of these roles runs; not normally invoked by the user directly. Use when a pipeline stage needs its Codex sub-agent dispatched, resumed for a fix round, or re-run.

# Dispatch a Codex sub-agent

## Dispatch: $ARGUMENTS

Read `.references/artifact-storage.md`. Pass its rule and the task's Grain
workspace ID in every dispatch, including direct role-file dispatches. Return
safe reports and artifact paths to the caller for sync before local cleanup;
retain completion markers and required working files until consumed.

Run one Codex sub-agent non-interactively and hand its report back to the
caller. One dispatch = one role + its inputs. Codex is the OpenAI coding
agent CLI; each dispatch is a fresh GPT-6.1 Sol session that knows nothing about
this conversation - the prompt must carry everything the role needs.

## Role table

| Role | Model / effort | Sandbox | Session |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `implementer` | `gpt-6.1-sol` / `medium` | `--yolo` | persistent - resume for fix rounds |
| `backend-verifier` | `gpt-6.1-sol` / `low` | `--yolo` | `--ephemeral` |
| `plan-reviewer` | `gpt-6.1-sol` / `low` | `--yolo` | `--ephemeral` |
| `code-reviewer` | `gpt-6.1-sol` / `low` | `--yolo` | `--ephemeral` |
| `code-researcher` | `gpt-6.1-sol` / `low` | `--yolo` | `--ephemeral` |
| `investigator` | `gpt-6.1-sol` / `low` | `--yolo` | `--ephemeral` |

Efforts are defaults: `medium` for the implementer and the refactor roles, `low` for every other role. The dispatcher may raise a reviewer to `medium` or
`high` - rarely, when the zone warrants it (zone 0, or a multi-phase item), with the
reason stated in the dispatch; never above `high`, never by default. The investigator and
backend-verifier act on the environment (tests, scripts, app boots), but
their charters forbid editing project files.

**Approvals must never gate a pipeline dispatch.** Every role runs with
`--yolo` (`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`) - the run is
unattended, and an approval prompt or approval-layer refusal mid-flight burns
the dispatch. The operator authorizes this via the /do preflight harness
check. Reviewer/researcher dispatches are still no-edit by charter (see
Rules: one that edited files is a failed run) - the guarantee is the charter
plus a diff check. The `implementer` role covers
every surface - backend/ops and frontend web/mobile alike, one effort
(`medium`), one session per slice.

## Steps

### 1. Build the prompt
Every prompt names the role instructions and output format by absolute path -
Codex reads them itself:

```
You are acting as the <role> in an automated software-development pipeline
conducted by the Overseer, a separate orchestrating agent. You are a
sub-agent - a leaf of this pipeline: never spawn further agents or invoke
agent CLIs (`codex exec`, `claude`, or any equivalent) - do the work in
this session yourself and print your report. Your report is
consumed by the Overseer, not by a human. <omit for the implementer, whose
work product is the diff and the updated plan.md: It is the sole evidence
the Overseer acts on; what you miss, the pipeline misses.>

First read these two files:
1. Your role instructions: <instructions path per the mapping below>.
2. Your output format: <format path per the mapping below> - your
   final message must follow it exactly.

Inputs for this run:
- work item: <item path - capture-time dispatches only; inside a /do run, sub-agents work from the implementation plan, not the brief (sole exception: the plan-reviewer also gets the brief - checking the plan against it is its job)>
- plan: <plan path, if the role uses one>
- question / defect report: <for code-researcher / investigator>
- review pass: <k>/<cap> <reviewers only - the dispatch states the resolved cap; /do derives it from the run's zone>
- prior findings by ID: <reviewers, pass 2+> / fix instructions: <implementer fix rounds>

Print the report as your final message, in exactly the specified format.
```

Role instructions: Codex-only roles (implementer, investigator,
backend-verifier, refactor-simple, refactor-deep) → `.references/agents/<role>/instructions.md` · roles
with a Claude twin (code-researcher, plan-reviewer, code-reviewer) →
`.claude/agents/<role>.md` (tell Codex to follow the body and ignore the
YAML frontmatter - it applies to a different harness).

Format files, under `.references/agents/<role>/`: implementer →
`implementation-result.md` · plan-reviewer / code-reviewer →
`review-report.md` · code-researcher → `codebase-findings.md` ·
investigator → `root-cause-finding.md` · backend-verifier →
`../frontend-verifier/verification-result.md` (shared verifier format,
verify mode) · refactor-simple / refactor-deep → `refactor-report.md`.

**Path resolution**: under Agent Farm, `.references/` is the bundled
references folder named in your instructions, and `.claude/agents/<role>.md`
is `.references/claude-agents/<role>.md` inside it. Write both paths into the
prompt as absolute paths, and add this line to every prompt so the role can
follow the links inside those files: `Paths written as .references/<path>
mean <absolute bundled references folder>/<path>.` Confirm both files exist
before dispatching - a role that can't read its instructions improvises
instead of failing.

**Success criteria**: prompt carries the role, both file paths (resolved
per the rule above, existence checked), and every input the role needs -
nothing assumed from this conversation.

### 2. Execute
At every turn start, before launching new work, inspect
`.codex-dispatches/${ORCHESTRA_DISPATCH_OWNER:-local}/*.done`. Pick up each
completed report, then delete all files with that dispatch's basename after
consuming it. Delete-on-consume is load-bearing: markers otherwise persist and
the daemon deliberately enqueues at most one resume per marker.

Delete with **literal paths only** - resolve the owner directory and the
dispatch name first, then write them out in full:

```bash
rm -f .codex-dispatches/local/code-researcher-1756340000-4242-1.{prompt,sh,log,md,done}
```

Never `rm` a path built from a shell variable or a glob under one
(`rm -f "$dir/$name".*`): Claude Code's critical-path check prompts on that
form even in bypass mode, and the prompt halts an unattended run.

Launch every dispatch fully detached from the harness, from the repo root. The
owner directory is `.codex-dispatches/$ORCHESTRA_DISPATCH_OWNER` when the daemon
sets that variable to the Linear session UUID, and `.codex-dispatches/local`
otherwise. Prepare it once per worktree:

```bash
own="${ORCHESTRA_DISPATCH_OWNER:-local}"; dir=".codex-dispatches/$own"
mkdir -p "$dir"
exclude="$(git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude)"
grep -qxF '/.codex-dispatches/' "$exclude" 2>/dev/null || printf '/.codex-dispatches/\n' >> "$exclude"
```

For each launch choose
`<name>=<role>-<epoch>-$$-<sequence>`, where the caller sequence is unique among
concurrent launches. Write the prompt to `<name>.prompt` with a quoted heredoc,
then write this launcher as `<name>.sh` (substitute the concrete paths and
arguments while writing it):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV or die "exec failed: $!"' <cap> \
  codex exec -m gpt-6.1-sol -c model_reasoning_effort="<effort>" --yolo \
  [--ephemeral] --skip-git-repo-check -C <repo root> \
  -o <owner dir>/<name>.md "$(cat <owner dir>/<name>.prompt)" </dev/null
status=$?
echo "$status" > <owner dir>/<name>.done.tmp && \
  mv <owner dir>/<name>.done.tmp <owner dir>/<name>.done
```

Use a 900-second `<cap>` for `--ephemeral` roles and 2700 for the implementer.
Redirect stdin as shown because Codex can hang on an open idle pipe. Detach the
launcher itself with Perl's portable `setsid` (macOS has no `setsid` binary):

```bash
nohup perl -MPOSIX -e 'POSIX::setsid(); exec @ARGV or die "exec failed: $!"' \
  bash <owner dir>/<name>.sh > <owner dir>/<name>.log 2>&1 & disown
```

For an implementer fix round, use the same launcher and marker write, replacing
its command with the following so session context survives:

```bash
perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV or die "exec failed: $!"' 2700 \
  codex exec resume --last --yolo -o <owner dir>/<name>.md \
  "$(cat <owner dir>/<name>.prompt)" </dev/null
status=$?
echo "$status" > <owner dir>/<name>.done.tmp && \
  mv <owner dir>/<name>.done.tmp <owner dir>/<name>.done
```

A resume dispatch carries `--yolo` exactly like a fresh one - a resumed
session that loses it runs sandboxed and blocks the very tests the fix
round must run. `resume` takes no `-C`: it matches recorded sessions by
cwd, so launch it from the same repo root as the original dispatch.

The marker convention is: `<name>.md` is the final report, `<name>.log` is
durable stdout/stderr including the `tokens used` summary, and `<name>.done`
contains exactly the exit code. The `.done` file is written even for failures,
including watchdog exit 142. A tracked wait loop may poll only the marker for
in-turn pickup; its death at turn end is harmless because the detached Codex
process survives and turn-start pickup covers recovery.

Parallel dispatches (e.g. several code-researchers, or a reviewer alongside a
Claude sub-agent) are launched together. A dual-lane review that does not issue
the detached launches together serializes the lanes and doubles wall-clock.

**Success criteria**: `.done` exists, contains 0, and the sibling `.md` exists
and is non-empty. Exit 142 is the watchdog's SIGALRM reap signature: it is a
classified failure, not a success, and step 3 handles it.

**Codex unavailable**: when a dispatch fails because Codex itself is
unavailable (its `.log` shows a usage limit, quota, or authentication error,
or `codex` is not installed), do not wait for a reset. Run the same role as a
Claude sub-agent with the same prompt and the same two files. A role with a
Claude twin (code-researcher, code-reviewer, plan-reviewer, web-researcher)
uses that agent; any other role (implementer, backend-verifier, investigator,
refactor-simple, refactor-deep) runs as a `general-purpose` sub-agent with an
explicit `model` (default `opus`) and the leaf-agent line. Implementer fix
rounds go back to the same sub-agent. Record `runtime_fallback: claude` and
the `fallback_cause` in `plan.md`, and route the rest of the run's Codex roles
to Claude the same way.

### 3. Return the report
Read the output file. Check the status line the format requires (reviewers:
`**Verdict:**` + `**Counts:**` with the Must Fix count - a reviewer report
that arrives tiered P0–P3 instead is a valid report, not a failed run:
P0/P1 ≡ Must Fix, P2 ≡ Should Fix, P3 ≡ Nice to Have; map the tiers,
synthesize the status line from the mapped counts yourself, and never
burn a retry or re-dispatch over format · implementer:
`**Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT` ·
code-researcher: `**Bottom line:**` · investigator: `**Root cause:**` with a
confidence word · backend-verifier: `**Verdict:**` pass|fail). Capture the
token usage `codex exec` prints in its end-of-run summary from the dispatch's
sibling `.log` file (the line after `tokens used`); per-turn detail lives in
`~/.codex/sessions/<date>/rollout-*.jsonl` `token_count` events. `unknown` is
only legal after checking both. For a resumed session the printed figure is
**cumulative**: record the delta from the previous dispatch's figure as the
round's cost and the final figure as the role total. Return the
report verbatim to the caller, prefixed with one line:
`CODEX <role>: <status line> · tokens <n | unknown>` - the Overseer sums
these per role into the wrap-up's run record.

Exit 142 (a SIGALRM watchdog reap) classifies the dispatch as a hung run. Retry
a hung, errored, timed-out, or status-line-missing run once: make a fresh
dispatch for an ephemeral role, or use `resume --last` for the implementer so
its session context survives. A retry that is also reaped never gets a third
Codex dispatch - a workload that wedged twice stays wedged: reviewer,
researcher, and verifier work routes to a Claude sub-agent dispatch instead;
the implementer has no Claude counterpart, so a twice-reaped implementer
returns the error plus whatever output exists to the caller. Otherwise return
the error plus whatever output exists after the single retry. A report of `listen EPERM` (the sandbox denied loopback
binds) is a completed run, not a failure: accept the edits and run the blocked
check at the Overseer, or hand it to the next verifier dispatch, instead of
re-dispatching.

**Success criteria**: caller received a well-formed report (or the error
after one retry).

## Rules

- One dispatch, one role - never batch two roles into one Codex session.
- Every dispatch prompt carries the leaf-agent line from the template (you
  are a sub-agent; never spawn agents or invoke agent CLIs). A sub-agent
  that doesn't know it's a sub-agent can recursively spawn agent sessions -
  `--yolo` gives it the shell to do it. A report showing the run invoked
  `codex exec` or `claude` is a failed run; treat its output as suspect.
- Never describe the artifact under review as verified, tested, correct, or
  previously approved in a reviewer dispatch. Re-review dispatches present
  prior findings as claimed fixed, to be verified.
- Reviewer and researcher dispatches are read-only: one that edited files is
  a failed run, treat its output as suspect.
- Don't launch a second implementer session while one is resumable -
  `resume --last` preserves its context across fix rounds.
